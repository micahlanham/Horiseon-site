# Horiseonsite
This project was to take a preset code and refactor it to meet the needs of the assignment. Below are the changes I made to the html/css. Added ID to the "search engine optimization" div. Added alts to the imgs on index.html. Removed "calibri" font style from style.css due to not being compatible with code. Added notes to the CSS page.
